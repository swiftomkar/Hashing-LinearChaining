# LinearChaining 
## A hash map implementation of Bob Jenkin's hashing technique 
https://burtleburtle.net/bob/

Made this out of curiosity of hash maps and how they store and get back data in ~O(1)! 
The idea is to explore if hashing techniques can be imporved.

The evaluation was done by loading an english dictionary in the hashmap. The results look good.

Results:
```
192933 - No Collisions
9818 - 1 Collision
314 - 2 Collisions
12 - 3 Collisions
0
0
```
